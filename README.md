👶 Meet Team Multi-Tasking Moms and One Power Researcher!

👩‍🍼 First Up: Our Tallinn Superstar Maarja! She's 34, originally from Estonia, and currently juggling the joys and challenges of a 6-week-old infant who demands a lot of attention. Between diaper changes and sleepless nights, she’s also finding time to rock this course!

👧👦 Next: The Rae Village Dynamo! Hailing from Harjumaa, this 32-year-old supermom Kristi is raising a lively duo—a 7-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy. When she’s not breaking up sibling squabbles, she’s breaking down coding problems like a pro!

🔋 From Estonia to Latvia: Diana - The Powerhouse Researcher from Riga! She’s diving deep into the energy field at Riga Technical University. With some Python and pandas experience under her belt, she's here to supercharge her IT and programming skills. Watch out world, she's ready to electrify this course!

Together, they're a formidable team balancing motherhood and career aspirations, proving that multitasking is their middle name. Let's give it up for this incredible quartet of coding queens! 🎉💻👩‍👧‍👦

## Team rules:

We introduce ourselves in the new team

We select a team lead

Team lead makes a GitHub repo

We all together make a README.md file describing our team and the project

Every team member contributes to that repo directly or through pull requests

We support each other and our activities will be registered in GitHub

### Terms "push", "pull", "commit", and "add" refer to specific actions that manage changes to your code. Here’s a simple explanation of each term:

1. Add
   
What it means: Adding means to stage your changes. This prepares your changes to be committed.
How to use it: When you make changes to files, you use git add to include those changes in the next commit.

2. Commit

What it means: Committing means to save your staged changes to the local repository. Each commit is like a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time.
How to use it: After staging changes with git add, you use git commit to save them. You should include a commit message to describe what changes were made.

3. Push

What it means: Pushing means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available to others.
How to use it: After committing your changes, you use git push to upload them to the remote repository.

4. Pull

What it means: Pulling means to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository. This updates your local copy with changes made by others.
How to use it: You use git pull to download changes from the remote repository and merge them into your current branch.
