Terms "push", "pull", "commit", and "add" refer to specific actions that manage changes to your code. Here’s a simple explanation of each term:

1. Add
What it means: Adding means to stage your changes. This prepares your changes to be committed.
How to use it: When you make changes to files, you use git add to include those changes in the next commit.
2. Commit
What it means: Committing means to save your staged changes to the local repository. Each commit is like a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time.
How to use it: After staging changes with git add, you use git commit to save them. You should include a commit message to describe what changes were made.
3. Push
What it means: Pushing means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available to others.
How to use it: After committing your changes, you use git push to upload them to the remote repository.
4. Pull
What it means: Pulling means to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository. This updates your local copy with changes made by others.
How to use it: You use git pull to download changes from the remote repository and merge them into your current branch.
