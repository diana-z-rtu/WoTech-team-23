1. Calculate total Sales by City

SELECT o.City, SUM(pr.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s 
JOIN Pets p ON s.PetID = p.PetID
JOIN Owners o ON p.OwnerID = o.OwnerID
JOIN Procedures pr ON s.ProcedureCode = pr.ProcedureCode
GROUP BY o.City;

2. Calculate total Sales by Pet Kind

SELECT p.Kind AS PetKind, SUM(pr.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Pets p ON s.PetID = p.PetID
JOIN Procedures pr ON s.ProcedureCode = pr.ProcedureCode
GROUP BY p.Kind;

3. Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind

SELECT o.City AS City, p.Kind AS PetKind, SUM(pr.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Pets p ON s.PetID = p.PetID
JOIN Owners o ON p.OwnerID = o.OwnerID
JOIN Procedures pr ON s.ProcedureCode = pr.ProcedureCode
GROUP BY o.City, p.Kind;

4. Calculate Average sales by City

-- Calculate the total sales for each city
WITH CityTotals AS (
    SELECT o.City AS City, SUM(pr.Price) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales s
    JOIN Pets p ON s.PetID = p.PetID
    JOIN Owners o ON p.OwnerID = o.OwnerID
    JOIN Procedures pr ON s.ProcedureCode = pr.ProcedureCode
    GROUP BY o.City)

-- Compute the average sales across all cities
SELECT AVG(TotalSales) AS AverageSales
FROM CityTotals;

-- average sales of each city
SELECT o.City AS City, AVG(pr.Price) AS AverageSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Pets p ON s.PetID = p.PetID
JOIN Owners o ON p.OwnerID = o.OwnerID
JOIN Procedures pr ON s.ProcedureCode = pr.ProcedureCode
GROUP BY o.City;
